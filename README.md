# Happy Accra Places API

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple API for managing places in Happy Accra. As a software engineer, this exercise is designed to enhance my understanding of building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express. It provides a foundation for developing more complex backend services.

The software includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting places. This program helps beginners understand how to build and interact with RESTful APIs.

## Purpose
The purpose of creating this software is to practice using Node.js and Express for basic API functionality in a web development environment. It also provides a starting point for understanding server-side scripting and interacting with databases through API endpoints.
